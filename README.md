# Shaker Plugin Example Project

This is an example Unreal Engine 4 project to demonstrate Shaker, a plugin inspired from the built-in camera shake system to shake actors in your levels.

## Usage

The plugin provides a scene component and a generic shake blueprint class used to define shake presets. Download the project to get a clearer idea on how to use the plugin.

## Support

Feel free to use the issues pages for feedback.
